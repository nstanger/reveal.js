/**
 * Positioning images within a container can be fiddly, especially when you're
 * dealing with vector images of unspecified size. This plugin helps in two ways.
 * 
 * First it provides simple positioning keywords for the six basic positions
 * (top, left, bottom, right, center, middle), which can be combined in the
 * obvious ways.
 * 
 * Second, it can automatically scale the image so that its largest dimension
 * is maximised within its parent container.
 * 
 * Note this only applies to the IMG element, not any other method of embedding
 * images in HTML. It works very well with the inline-svg plugin, but should
 * be loaded first.
 *
 * To use this, you need to place the image inside a container DIV with the class
 * "img-container". The IMG itself should have the class "align", followed by
 * one or more of the six positioning classes ("top", "left", "bottom", "right",
 * "center"/"centre", "middle"). If no positioning classes are specified, the
 * image will just be positioned statically, which can lead to unpredictable
 * results across browsers. Usually in such cases youâ€™d be wanting to explicitly
 * specify coordinates anyway. If you specify conflicting classes (e.g., both
 * "top" and "bottom"), the last one specified wins.
 * 
 * You may also include the class "maximize" (or "maximise", we're dialect
 * agnostic ;) to make the image scale to fit its container as best as possible.
 *

		A cross-browser weirdness: in Firefox, max-height (or max-width) for the image is consistently returned as the computed height (in pixels) rather than the specified height (which is a percentage). In WebKit, the percentage value is returned, which seems more as you would expect.
		
		Conversely, window.getComputedStyle() is supposed to always return the computed value in pixels, but experiment has shown that in WebKit it returns the percentage (!).
		
		We therefore need to manually calculate the maximum dimensions for the image in pixels. The quick check for this is to look for a "%" in the returned value, and assume that it's in pixels otherwise (it seems very unlikely that it would be anything else!).
		
		Fortunately, parseInt() is intelligent enough to work in either case.
